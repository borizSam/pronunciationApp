# Spring Boot and MVC to a 5yo kid

> Imagine a <mark>big restaurant</mark> called `Spring Boot`. 

Here's how it works:

- The menu is like the `View`. It shows you all the yummy food you can order.

- When you come in, you meet the maitre. They're like the `Front Controller`, welcoming you and guiding you to your table.

- The waiter is like the `Controller`. They take your order and make sure you get what you wan.

- Once the waiter has the order,  our restaurant is so big that all the waiters are queuing to deliver the orders to the **kitchen**: it's where all the food is prepared. Our restaurant has a <mark>orders-board</mark> where the waiter boss pins the order, it is like the `Service`.  

- In the kitchen, there's a chef who's like `JPA`. They know all the recipes and how to make the dishes just right.

- The cook is like `SQL queries.` They do the actual cooking, following the chef's instructions.

- Each plate has a super-sercret code just for superheroes, this secret code is the `id` at `database`.

- All the ingredients are kept in the pantry and fridge, which is like the `database`.

- And finally, the plates and dishes are like the `Model`. They hold all the delicious food that comes to your table.

- Imagine you want pizza at home. The `API Rest` is like a super-fast delivery superhero who brings your yummy food exactly where you want it!

- What if you could watch chefs cooking? The `WebSocket` is like a magical window where you see everything happening in the kitchen, right when it's happening!

- The `Security` is like a kind and strong firend who makes sure only nice people can enter and keeps all the secret recipes safe.

- The `Thymeleaf Templates` and `Vaadin` create super cool, colorful menus that make you smile and want to try everything.

- When you want the perfect meal, the `AI` is like a magic waiter who knows exactly what you like and suggests the most delicious food just for you!

- Someone needs to make sure everything works perfectly. The `Actuator` is like the restaurant's superhero manager who watches over everything.

- What if restaurants could help each other? The `Spring Cloud` is like a big friendly restaurant family that shares cool tricks and helps everyone.

- Want to cook something amazing super fast? The `Spring Initializr` is like a magic kitchen that appears instantly, ready to make any delicious meal you want!

All these parts work together to make sure you have a great meal at the <mark>Spring Boot restaurant!</mark>
